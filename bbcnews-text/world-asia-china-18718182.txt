Uighurs and Xinjiang
Uighurs are ethnically Turkic Muslims
They make up about 45% of the region's population; 40% are Han Chinese
China re-established control in 1949 after crushing short-lived state of East Turkestan
Since then, large-scale immigration of Han Chinese
Uighurs fear erosion of traditional culture
The Turkic-speaking Uighurs, who have lived in China's shadow for centuries, accuse Beijing of religious and political persecution.'Iron fists'
 Mr Zhang, who is Communist Party secretary of the Xinjiang committee, urged soldiers to remain vigilant against hostile forces and strike separatists, terrorists and extremists with ''iron fists'', Xinhua says."We should leave terrorists no place to hide," he said, adding that the region was stable but faced "severe challenges". London-based rights group Amnesty International (AI) issued a statement saying that Chinese authorities "continue to silence those speaking out on abuses" in the region."The general trend toward repression that we see all over China is particularly pronounced in Xinjiang," Catherine Baber, AI Asia-Pacific director, 
 said in a statement
 She urged the Chinese government to reveal the whereabouts of those who have disappeared and end the persecution of family members seeking answers.On Monday, there were reports that two Uighur men who allegedly tried to hijack a plane in Xinjiang had died.
